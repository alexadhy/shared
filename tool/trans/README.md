# Obtain Service Account Key

Create a project on Google Cloud then do:

1. Create a service account: https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/
2. Make it as owner (actually bad, but whatever)
3. Create a key for the service account
4. The key is downloaded to your local disk
5. In your service account browser, copy the service account id (it's called Email)
6. Go to your google drive, share the spreadsheet you want with that service account id (ex: alex-13@your-appname-20210229.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
7. If you're in an organization, you need to tell your org admin
