# Melos

A mono repo flutter manager.

## STATUS

Its i feel still too raw. I only got a little time to try it out and I got the feeling its too new as many things dont work as the docs suggest.

 And i sort of hate that its dart / flutter dependent when its really just wrapping best practcie things and we have an approach using JSONNET.
