# Routers

Flutter Router is a mess in many ways and there is a Flutter Team Research project to make it better

VRouter is one of the implemenations that copies how VueJS works.

Declaritive
we need a declaritive router in order to allow runtime based changing of the Routes: See here: https://github.com/lulupointu/vrouter/issues/2
this will then make it easy to gen docs, add runtime generated cards, and a whole lot more of what we actually need.
